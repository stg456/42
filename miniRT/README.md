# miniRT
Welcome to our page for the miniRT project of school 42!

In this project, we are building our own raytracer in C language.
The raytracer renders images in real-time using the minilibx. It requires a .rt file as parameter.
The .rt file contains the scene description following these rules:
// Describe .rt file here //

You can of course make your own scene in a .rt file and use it with this program.

Things that we might add in the future:
- Saving results in a .bmp or .png file
- Camera transformation and rotation
- Anti-aliasing
- Transparency
- and maybe more...
